The practice problems for this Lab will provide hands on experience with the different kinds of join operations
that we learned in this Module. 

We will be using the same HR Database that we used in the previous module.
IMPORTANT: This lab assumes that you have already created and populated the tables in the sample HR database
schema illustrated below in your instance of Db2 on IBM Cloud. 
If you have not done this yet, please complete the lab in the previous module before you start this one.
